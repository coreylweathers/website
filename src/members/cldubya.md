Greetings all. I am Corey "Hurricane" Weathers and I love building things with other people. While I will often include a bit of C# or .NET in my streams, you can always expect to find a warm, respectful, and friendly environment full of supportive developers who love building together. Join us weekly as we build apps, chat code newbie related topics, or interview different guests & friends from the developer community. I can't wait to see you there ðŸ˜‰
